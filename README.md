# 🌙 Mikazuki Bot

Mikazuki is an early experimental **fully local AI companion bot** originally built in **August 2025** as a passion project. It explored character-driven conversation, emotional presence, and what it means for an AI to feel like *someone* rather than just a tool.

This repository is open-sourced for **educational, archival, and experimental purposes**. The architecture reflects early-stage ideas and rapid prototyping rather than production-ready design, and many parts are intentionally simple or hacky.

Mikazuki is historically important as a first step toward later, more advanced companion systems. Think of it as a fossil record of early local AI experimentation — imperfect, outdated, but foundational.
